# CURB-Detection

This project explores lane curb detection using two distinct techniques: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) in machine learning (ML) and the Hough Transform in image processing. While CNN leverages ML for pattern recognition and classification, Hough Transform directly processes image data to detect lines. Through a comparative study, this project evaluates the effectiveness, accuracy, and computational efficiency of both approaches in detecting lane curbs, offering insights into their respective strengths and limitations in real-world applications.
